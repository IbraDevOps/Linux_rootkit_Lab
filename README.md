 Secure Healthcare Data Management System on GCP



A cloud-native healthcare data management system built on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), focused on security, scalability, and compliance. This project demonstrates secure handling of sensitive patient records using modern GCP services and best practices.

 Core Components

- Flask API hosted on Compute Engine for managing patient records
- Cloud SQL for structured patient data storage
- Cloud Storage for encrypted file uploads (PDF reports)
- Cloud Functions for serverless event handling & logging
- Firebase Hosting for frontend delivery
- Security & Monitoring: IAM, VPC Service Controls, Cloud Audit Logs, Monitoring Dashboards

  Technologies

- Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- Python (Flask), HTML, JavaScript
- Firebase CLI, Google Cloud SDK, MySQL

  Features

- Role-based access control using IAM
- Encrypted storage and secure SQL access
- Audit logging for compliance and monitoring
- Serverless logging of patient report uploads

  Learning Goals

- Cloud security (IAM, encryption, audit logging)
- Scalable GCP architecture
- Secure API + frontend integration
